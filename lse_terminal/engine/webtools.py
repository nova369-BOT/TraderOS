"""Web tools for the local terminal's AI panel: search, read a page, render a page.

WHY THESE RUN ON THE USER'S OWN MACHINE
The terminal is a download that runs on the user's computer, and it already
fetches from the internet there (the research paper reader). Search and page
reading work the same way: their machine, their IP, their network, exactly like
their browser. We do NOT proxy this through LSE. Routing strangers' page fetches
through our servers would mean carrying their traffic, their bandwidth and their
choice of URL, and it would put an LSE IP behind every page a user asks about.
(The HOSTED assistant is the opposite case and does use a sandboxed egress
service, because there the fetch is decided by a stranger and must not
originate on our backend directly.)

WHY STDLIB ONLY
The terminal's install is deliberately thin: no httpx, no requests, no
trafilatura. Everything here is urllib plus pypdf, which is already a
dependency for the paper reader. A web tool that needed a new package would
either bloat every install or silently not work in the frozen desktop build.
`browse` is the one exception and degrades to a clear instruction when
Playwright is absent, the same way the PDF reader does.

SSRF GUARD
The risk here is not our infrastructure, it is the user's own network. A page
(or a prompt-injected instruction inside one) can ask the agent to fetch
http://192.168.1.1/ or a cloud metadata address and read the result back. Every
hop is checked, not just the first URL, because a public host can redirect
inward.
