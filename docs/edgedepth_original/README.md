# EdgeDepth Terminal

**An open-source orderflow terminal and local market-data replay/testing workbench that runs in your browser.**

C++20 compiled to WebAssembly. Dear ImGui + ImPlot for immediate-mode rendering, SDL3 + WebGL2 underneath, protobuf over WebSocket for data. No Electron, no DOM in the hot path, no garbage collector between you and the tape.

![The Replay Library replaying a TUT short squeeze: an empty terminal fills with chart, DOM and tape, then the climax prints](assets/replay-library-tut.gif)

*A real +856% short squeeze replayed from a static `.edpack` file in the built-in Replay Library: no feed, no account, no replay server. ([still screenshot](assets/screenshot.png))*

This is the full source of the terminal that powers [EdgeDepth](https://edgedepth.com/open-source?utm_source=github&utm_medium=oss&utm_campaign=terminal): the same canvas, the same widgets, the same render loop. It is not a demo build or a stripped-down "community edition."

Run it against a local exchange feed, point it at your own wire-compatible data,
or use deterministic `.edpack` recordings as repeatable fixtures. If you prefer
a managed feed and stored history, open the [hosted live terminal](https://app.edgedepth.com/terminal?utm_source=github&utm_medium=oss&utm_campaign=terminal).

## Product gallery

These are captures of the actual terminal. The open-source renderer supports
these views; the data source determines which layers have coverage. Hosted
market data and history access are separate from the open-source license.

Screenshots use landscape framing. Select an image to inspect the original
at full size.

### Full workspace

![Terminal workspace with chart, watchlist, depth ladder and trade tape](assets/screenshot.png)

*Existing hosted BTC workspace capture. Chart layers, docking, DOM and tape are
part of the OSS renderer. Hosted analytics and stored history are not bundled
with the community gateway.*

### Real-time depth

![Live SOPH observed depth, trade bubbles and linked DOM with delta and CVD](assets/terminal-rt-live.png)

*Local browser build connected to the community gateway's Binance Futures feed.
SOPH/USDT capture from 8 September 2026 with the linked six-column DOM, delta
and CVD. Actual observed depth and received trades, with no pre-join depth backfill.*

Choose **Real-time** beside the timeframe bar to watch observed orderbook history,
sampled best bid/ask steps and trade bubbles on one price axis. Individual bubbles retain
received execution prices and timestamps; dense views group volume by time and
side at average prices, with a label. Zoom in to recover individual records.
Quotes and trades are separate streams, so a print can lie outside the sampled
spread. Bubbles are never moved onto a quote to make them fit.

RT records browser-local history from activation, targeting 30 minutes within a
shared 256 MiB compressed storage budget. The menu shows actual coverage and
provides Whole session and Return live. Detail uses 100ms observed samples; wide
views use mean depth bins. The deeper blue cool-to-warm palette is the default.
The linked price axis fits the visible observed history by default. Display
price groups expand as needed to keep DOM rows readable, and return to finer
detail after sustained spare room. Grouping changes recalibrate colors; retained
observations stay unchanged. Turn off Auto-fit visible history for fixed grouping. Optional candles, a trade-price line,
auto/manual bubble thresholds and price fidelity are available in the menus.

Continuous replay, pause and seeking work with recordings containing a valid
seed and continuous depth. Pack seeks reconstruct the book from the opening
seed through the target and hold the clock during catch-up. Later seeks can
require more loading because existing packs have no intermediate checkpoints.
Original trade timestamps and replay cutoffs remain intact. Missing source
links still leave RT waiting for synchronized depth.

See the [RT guide](docs/REALTIME_DEPTH.md) for screenshots, settings, replay steps,
retention limits and the distinction between quotes and executions. Standalone
feeds and local packs need no Pro account; hosted live RT uses the Pro view gate.

### Diagonal and stacked footprints

![Recorded TUT footprint with diagonal 3:1 imbalances and three-level stacks](assets/terminal-diagonal-stacks.png)

*Actual local TUT v2 replay capture, paused at 07:03:53 UTC on 9 August 2026.
Comparison is Diagonal, ratio 3:1, stack levels 3, with Imbalance Highlights
on. Thick green outlines identify consecutive qualifying buy imbalances.
Only closed-minute volume available at the replay clock is displayed.*

### Live footprints

![Real BTC footprint cells with buy and sell volume, imbalance outlines and partial live volume](assets/terminal-live-footprint.png)

*Hosted live BTC capture supplied on 7 September 2026. Footprints support
same-price or diagonal comparisons and consecutive stacked imbalances. In
Settings, choose Imbalances > Diagonal, ratio 3, stack levels 3, and enable
Display > Imbalance Highlights. Thin outlines mark imbalances; thicker outlines
mark qualifying stacks. The forming minute is observed, partial volume;
completed snapshots replace it when available. This capture illustrates the
renderer and is not evidence that the latest continuity repair is deployed.*

### Recorded replay

![TUT recorded replay with chart, order book, trade tape and paused playback controls](assets/terminal-recorded-replay.png)

*Local product capture from the published TUT v2 `.edpack`, recorded on 9 August
2026. Playback runs locally after the pack loads. Replay footprint analysis uses
closed minutes at the replay clock; it does not invent future or missing data.*

The reported 180 FPS is an observation from one setup, not a performance
guarantee. Hardware, browser, viewport and enabled layers affect frame rate.

### Connection and depth coverage

Live sockets retry automatically after closure, with a 1-30 second backoff.
The status bar distinguishes connecting, retrying, open/waiting, and frame age.
Frame age measures traffic on that socket, not completeness of every layer.
Paused subscriptions remain paused. A network replay interrupted by closure
keeps its last frame paused and asks you to reopen replay; local packs do not
need the socket.

Recent observed depth is retained for ten minutes across GPU rebuilds.
Authoritative history replaces older provisional columns when it arrives.
Unobserved minutes remain gaps, and history availability depends on the feed.
The current order book is never copied backward to fill those gaps.

## Quick start

The terminal and a live market data feed, both on your machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/edgedepthhq/edgedepth-terminal.git
cd edgedepth-terminal
docker compose up
```

Then open **http://localhost:8080**. No API key, no account, no signup. The
feed is [edgedepth-gateway](https://github.com/edgedepthhq/edgedepth-gateway),
a small MIT-licensed Go service that bridges Binance's public WebSocket
streams into this terminal's wire format.

Images are pulled prebuilt so this starts in seconds. To compile the
WebAssembly from source instead, `docker compose up --build` (that pulls the
Emscripten toolchain and takes a while).

**Browsers.** The canvas is threaded WebAssembly, so it needs WebGL2,
`SharedArrayBuffer` and a cross-origin-isolated page; the bundled nginx sends the
COOP and COEP headers that buys. Verified booting cross-origin isolated on
2026-08-15: **Chrome 149** and **Firefox 146**. Safari is untested rather than
supported: it has the pieces on paper, but nobody has run it, so treat it as
unknown. If the canvas never appears, check `crossOriginIsolated` in the
console: `false` means something upstream (a proxy, an extension) stripped the
headers.

**If the book moves but the tape is empty**, inspect `docker compose logs gateway`
and verify the gateway revision. Binance now separates `/market` trade streams
from `/public` depth streams. The local volume-history candidate uses both;
older images using the legacy combined endpoint can show a moving book with no
trades. Do not treat a trade-stream override as a general repair for an old
image. Regional/network availability still applies.

## Versions and pinning

Three kinds of tag are published for both images:

- `:latest` moves whenever a change lands on the default branch
- `:sha-<short>` names one commit, published on every default-branch build
- `:MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` and `:MAJOR.MINOR` are published when a release is tagged

One gotcha worth stating plainly, because the failure looks like the tag is
missing: the leading `v` is not part of the image tag. The git tag `v0.4.0`
publishes the images `0.4.0` and `0.4`, so `:v0.4.0` fails with
`manifest unknown` while `:0.4.0` is there.

The two images version independently, so their numbers do not match. Check
[the releases](https://github.com/edgedepthhq/edgedepth-terminal/releases) and
[the gateway's](https://github.com/edgedepthhq/edgedepth-gateway/releases) for
what is current, or ask the registry directly, which needs no login and no
Docker:

```bash
curl -s "https://ghcr.io/token?scope=repository:edgedepthhq/edgedepth-terminal:pull&service=ghcr.io" \
  | sed -n 's/.*"token":"\([^"]*\)".*/\1/p' \
  | xargs -I{} curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer {}" \
      https://ghcr.io/v2/edgedepthhq/edgedepth-terminal/tags/list
```

`docker-compose.yml` ships pinned to `:latest` deliberately, so the quick start
is current without editing anything. Pin a version when you want a build that
does not move under you:

```yaml
services:
  gateway:
    image: ghcr.io/edgedepthhq/edgedepth-gateway:0.1.0
  terminal:
    image: ghcr.io/edgedepthhq/edgedepth-terminal:0.4.0
```

A digest is the strongest pin, because a version tag can in principle be
repointed while a digest cannot:

```bash
docker compose pull
docker inspect --format='{{index .RepoDigests 0}}' ghcr.io/edgedepthhq/edgedepth-terminal:latest
docker inspect --format='{{index .RepoDigests 0}}' ghcr.io/edgedepthhq/edgedepth-gateway:latest
```

Put the resulting `name@sha256:...` in `docker-compose.yml` and you have both a
pin and a rollback target: keep the previous digest and you can go back to it.

## Why this exists

Web trading UIs are usually React apps fighting the DOM for every orderbook tick. This terminal takes the approach used by native trading software, an immediate-mode GUI redrawn every frame on the GPU, and ships it through WebAssembly. Frame rate depends on hardware, browser, viewport, data load and enabled layers. The earlier 180 FPS capture describes one setup, not a portable benchmark.

Open-source trade aggregators and charting components exist, but complete browser orderflow terminals in this class are rare. Most mature orderflow tools are closed and paid. This one is open: read it, build it, point it at your own data.

## Features

- **Chart engine**: custom ImPlot candlesticks, multi-timeframe (1m to 1D), buy/sell volume + CVD, indicators (RSI, MACD, Volume, OI, funding), drawing tools, layered overlays
- **Trade bubbles on candles**: large prints from the live tape are drawn inside their own bar at their received price and time, sized by value and thinned to a screen budget so zooming reveals more. Any feed supplies live prints; recorded bubbles for earlier bars need a backend that answers `get_candle_bubbles`
- **Flow & Positioning**: a chart view aligning selected-minute aggression with raw open-interest contracts and reported liquidations, with missing and stale states kept explicit and a JSON export. Needs a backend that answers `get_flow_positioning`; the community gateway serves live streams only, so it reports the evidence as unavailable rather than inventing it
- **DOM ladder**: independent depth with grouping, USD/coin modes and trade columns, or a default RT link sharing the chart's price positions, sampled book and pause state. See [the RT guide](docs/REALTIME_DEPTH.md).
- **Trade tape**: live time & sales with size highlighting
- **Orderbook heatmap**: GPU-rendered depth history via a shader-based renderer
- **Volume profile (VPVR) and footprint**: use supplied closed-minute per-price volume. The gateway candidate retains bounded observations after warmup; the CSV/Parquet example serves available source minutes. Pack coverage depends on its contents. Missing intervals remain gaps.
- **TPO / Market Profile**: a candle-range approximation in 30-minute blocks, not tick-by-tick time occupancy. Choose 30m or a smaller timeframe dividing 30m. No available candles means no TPO.
- **Footprint imbalances**: same-price or diagonal buy/sell comparisons, configurable ratio and minimum volume, and consecutive same-side stacks. Uses available closed one-minute tick-volume buckets; replay excludes buckets ending after the playhead. Right-click a footprint view in the chart menu, then choose Imbalances.
- **Liquidation heatmap layers**: the dense liquidation Field, leverage-tier levels, and profile rendering. The Field is computed client-side from candles, so it works on any feed
- **Market replay**: deterministic replay engine with scrubbing, and self-contained [`.edpack`](docs/EDPACK.md) files that play entirely client-side with no server
- **Replay Library**: a manifest-driven browser of free, curated `.edpack` recordings for local replay and regression testing
- **Paper trading**: simulated positions against live data
- **Docking layout**: drag, split, and persist panel arrangements (ImGui docking)
- **Watchlist / scanner**: every symbol the feed lists, with 24h stats. The bundled gateway serves about 900, of which 737 are Binance USDT-M perpetuals (counted 2026-08-15; exchanges list and delist, so expect drift)
- **Wire format**: zstd-compressed protobuf ([`protos/messages.proto`](protos/messages.proto)), decoded off the render thread

## Workspaces and reference context

Use **Workspace** in the full live terminal to save a named setup, switch between
Order Flow, Liquidity and Replay Review presets, or export/import a JSON backup.
Layout and panel settings restore in the same browser. Version 1 supports one
panel of each type for the current market. Replay and hosted embeds leave your
live workspace alone. Browser storage can be cleared, so export setups you need
to keep.

**Layers** includes session VWAP and previous-day/week high, low and close.
Right-click a candle to anchor VWAP. VWAP uses completed HLC3 candles weighted by
base volume; it is not exact trade-price VWAP. Sessions start at midnight UTC and
weeks on Monday. Missing bars stop VWAP and suppress incomplete period levels.
Use **Load reference history** when offered; the data source still determines
coverage. TPO and Renko do not display these overlays.

## Bring your own data

The terminal is a client. It speaks a documented protobuf-over-WebSocket wire format and connects to whatever feed you give it, resolved in this order:

1. `?ws=ws://localhost:8080/ws` (query parameter)
2. `window.__EDGEDEPTH_WS_URL__` (set by the host page before the WASM glue loads)
3. `wss://api.edgedepth.com/ws` (EdgeDepth's hosted backend, the default)

The schema in [`protos/messages.proto`](protos/messages.proto) is the contract.
Trades drive the tape and observed forming footprints; supplied candles drive
the chart and candle-range TPO. DOM and depth require actual book snapshots and
continuous deltas. Completed footprint snapshots and volume profiles need
per-price volume through `get_footprint_history` and `get_volume_profile`.
A trade CSV cannot reconstruct a historical order book.

**Write your own feed:** [`examples/synthetic_feed.py`](examples/synthetic_feed.py) is a working feed in one file, with no `protoc` step and no protobuf package. It answers historical candle requests and streams trades plus an order book, which is enough to drive the chart, the tape and the DOM. Run it and open the terminal with `?ws=ws://localhost:8765` to see your own data on the screen, then swap the random walk for a strategy, a simulator, or a replay of your own capture:

```bash
pip install websockets
python3 examples/synthetic_feed.py
```

**Start with a dataframe:** [the reproducible CSV/Parquet walkthrough](docs/DATAFRAME_WORKFLOW.md)
creates 7,200 explicitly generated trades and puts them on the chart, tape,
footprint and volume profile. No exchange access or credentials are required.

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -r examples/requirements.txt
python examples/dataframe_demo.py --output demo-data
python examples/file_feed.py demo-data/synthetic-btcusdt.parquet --symbol btcusdt --speed 10
```

With the terminal running locally, open
[the generated BTC fixture](http://localhost:8080/terminal/btcusdt?ws=ws%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3A8765).
The example requires explicit aggressor side, positive base-asset quantity and
source timestamps. It rejects unknown sides, negative sizes and future dates.
It advances sequentially through source time; use `.edpack` for seekable replay.

**Community gateway:** [edgedepth-gateway](https://github.com/edgedepthhq/edgedepth-gateway) is exactly that feed, MIT licensed. It serves trades, candles, orderbook, stats and liquidations from Binance's free public streams, and answers historical candle requests from their REST klines so the chart boots with real history. It also builds **1s, 5s, 15s and 30s candles** trade by trade from the raw stream, updating the building candle as each trade arrives. The local gateway candidate also retains up to 60 minutes / 50,000 price-minute cells per active symbol for footprints and profiles. It starts at the next minute boundary after joining or detecting a gap, then closes the minute on a later trade. It has no historical trade backfill or disk persistence. See the [Quick start](#quick-start) to run both together.

A few layers are driven by EdgeDepth's proprietary analytics streams: VPIN toxicity, positioning and smart-money flow, modelled liquidation estimates, pattern detection, and the scanner's composite scores. With a raw-data feed those panels simply stay empty and the terminal degrades gracefully; [which panels, and why](https://edgedepth.com/open-source?utm_source=github&utm_medium=oss&utm_campaign=terminal#empty-panels) lists them side by side. The [hosted product](https://app.edgedepth.com/terminal?utm_source=github&utm_medium=oss&utm_campaign=terminal) provides them, along with historical replay and structured courses taught inside the terminal.

Run the terminal yourself with a live feed or a recording you already have.
The hosted product adds maintained feeds, stored market history and a connected
research workflow: define a condition, compare historical outcomes with a baseline,
inspect the available replay evidence, and save a search to revisit.

Research also provides REST API and MCP access. Searchable research history and
tick replay have different coverage and access limits; see the current
[plans](https://edgedepth.com/pricing?utm_source=github&utm_medium=oss&utm_campaign=terminal)
when you need hosted history or research capacity. Local replay remains part of
the open-source terminal and requires no hosted subscription.

## Replay Library and local test packs

No feed is required for a recording. In the top bar choose **Replay**, then
**Open Replay Library**. If a chart is already open, the same widget is under
**+ widget**, then **Replay Library**. A selected pack streams directly from
static hosting and replays locally with no account or replay server.

The checked-in [`replay-library/manifest.json`](replay-library/manifest.json)
is also the production catalog source. It currently lists four curated
recordings; additional picks can be published without rebuilding the terminal.

The terminal can play a self-contained `.edpack` recording entirely
client-side, with nothing but static file hosting behind it. Orderbook, tape,
liquidations, footprint and volume profile work where the pack actually includes
those streams; a pack is not a promise of every layer.

`.edpack` is EdgeDepth's own deterministic replay container. The format is
documented in [`docs/EDPACK.md`](docs/EDPACK.md): magic and version gating,
the protobuf header, the block index, framing, compression, what determinism
does and does not guarantee, and how a truncated pack fails.

```
?pack=<url-encoded pack URL>&packsym=<symbol>
```

Try one of the catalog's recordings directly: 30 tick-by-tick minutes from a
June 2026 ZEC selloff, including the order book, tape, liquidations, footprint
and volume profile data (53 MB):

```
http://localhost:8080/?pack=https%3A%2F%2Freplays.edgedepth.com%2Freplays%2Fzec_cascade_demo%2Fv1.edpack&packsym=zecusdt
```

The pack is fetched with HTTP range requests, block by block, as playback and
seeking need it. If you host packs yourself, the server (and any CDN in front
of it) must allow the `Range` header in its CORS policy and answer
`206 Partial Content`; a server that ignores `Range` and answers `200` with
the whole body forces the client to buffer the entire file into memory.

To use the widget with a private or local corpus, point it at another v1
manifest without rebuilding:

```text
?replayLibrary=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3A9000%2Fmanifest.json
```

Or set `window.__EDGEDEPTH_REPLAY_LIBRARY_URL__` before the WebAssembly glue
loads. See [`replay-library/README.md`](replay-library/README.md) for the
manifest and CORS contract. The self-hosted client contains no phone-home
analytics; public pack engagement can be measured from aggregate object
requests at the pack host.

## Building and platform support

The build target is WebAssembly, not a native operating-system executable. A
successful source build produces `index.html`, `index.js`, `index.wasm`, and
`index.data`. The build is threaded, so the server must return COOP and COEP
headers for `SharedArrayBuffer`; the bundled `serve_threaded.py` does this.

Source builds require:

- [Emscripten SDK](https://emscripten.org/docs/getting_started/downloads.html) **4.0.15 or newer**. SDL3 support is unavailable in Emscripten 3.x.
- **`protoc` 21.x**. The instructions below pin 21.12, which reports itself as `libprotoc 3.21.12`. Do not substitute a newer release family.
- CMake 3.15+ and Ninja.

All other dependencies are fetched and pinned by CMake. There are no
submodules or additional system libraries.

### Docker Desktop quick start

On Windows or macOS, install Docker Desktop and use Linux containers. Then:

```text
git clone https://github.com/edgedepthhq/edgedepth-terminal.git
cd edgedepth-terminal
docker compose up
```

Open `http://localhost:8080`. This pulls prebuilt images. To compile the
terminal from source inside the Linux build container, run
`docker compose up --build`. Docker Desktop is an alternative build path; it
does not exercise the native Windows toolchain described below.

### WSL2 source build

Install Ubuntu under WSL2 with `wsl --install -d Ubuntu` from an elevated
PowerShell window, then run the rest inside Ubuntu. Keeping the clone in the
WSL Linux filesystem avoids unnecessary `/mnt/c` filesystem overhead.

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y build-essential cmake curl git ninja-build python3 unzip

mkdir -p "$HOME/.local/protoc-21.12"
curl -fsSL \
  -o /tmp/protoc-21.12-linux-x86_64.zip \
  https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases/download/v21.12/protoc-21.12-linux-x86_64.zip
unzip -q /tmp/protoc-21.12-linux-x86_64.zip -d "$HOME/.local/protoc-21.12"
export PATH="$HOME/.local/protoc-21.12/bin:$PATH"

git clone https://github.com/emscripten-core/emsdk.git "$HOME/emsdk"
cd "$HOME/emsdk"
./emsdk install 4.0.15
./emsdk activate 4.0.15
source ./emsdk_env.sh

cd "$HOME"
git clone https://github.com/edgedepthhq/edgedepth-terminal.git
cd edgedepth-terminal

emcmake cmake -S . -B build-wsl -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build-wsl --target c_based_trader_client --parallel
for artifact in index.html index.js index.wasm index.data; do
  test -s "build-wsl/$artifact"
done
ls -l build-wsl/index.html build-wsl/index.js build-wsl/index.wasm build-wsl/index.data

cmake -S tests/native -B build-native-tests -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build-native-tests --config Release --parallel
cmake -E chdir build-native-tests ctest -C Release --output-on-failure

python3 serve_threaded.py 8000 build-wsl
```

Open `http://localhost:8000` from Windows. Add
`?ws=ws://localhost:8080/ws` to connect to your own feed.

The same commands are the supported Linux source-build path outside WSL2.

### Native Windows PowerShell and Ninja source build

Install Git, CMake 3.15+, Ninja, Python 3.8+, and Visual Studio 2022 Build
Tools with the Desktop development with C++ workload. Start a Developer
PowerShell for VS 2022 so the host compiler is available for the native tests.
The WASM build itself uses Emscripten's Clang.

From that PowerShell window, install the pinned tools for the current user:

```powershell
$ToolsRoot = Join-Path $env:LOCALAPPDATA "EdgeDepth\tools"
$EmsdkRoot = Join-Path $ToolsRoot "emsdk"
$ProtocRoot = Join-Path $ToolsRoot "protoc-21.12"
$ProtocZip = Join-Path $ToolsRoot "protoc-21.12-win64.zip"
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path $ToolsRoot | Out-Null

git clone https://github.com/emscripten-core/emsdk.git $EmsdkRoot
Push-Location $EmsdkRoot
.\emsdk.ps1 install 4.0.15
.\emsdk.ps1 activate 4.0.15
. .\emsdk_env.ps1
Pop-Location

Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases/download/v21.12/protoc-21.12-win64.zip" -OutFile $ProtocZip
Expand-Archive -LiteralPath $ProtocZip -DestinationPath $ProtocRoot -Force
$env:Path = "$(Join-Path $ProtocRoot 'bin');$env:Path"

emcc --version
protoc --version
ninja --version
```

The version checks must show Emscripten 4.0.15 and `libprotoc 3.21.12`.
Clone and build the terminal in the same Developer PowerShell session:

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/edgedepthhq/edgedepth-terminal.git
Set-Location edgedepth-terminal

emcmake.bat cmake -S . -B build-windows -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build-windows --target c_based_trader_client --parallel

$Artifacts = @("index.html", "index.js", "index.wasm", "index.data") |
  ForEach-Object { Join-Path "build-windows" $_ }
$Invalid = $Artifacts | Where-Object {
  -not (Test-Path -LiteralPath $_ -PathType Leaf) -or (Get-Item -LiteralPath $_).Length -eq 0
}
if ($Invalid) { throw "Missing or empty build artifacts: $($Invalid -join ', ')" }
Get-Item -LiteralPath $Artifacts

cmake -S tests/native -B build-native-tests -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build-native-tests --config Release --parallel
cmake -E chdir build-native-tests ctest -C Release --output-on-failure

python .\serve_threaded.py 8000 build-windows
```

Open `http://localhost:8000`. For later PowerShell sessions, dot-source
`emsdk_env.ps1` again and add the 21.12 `bin` directory to `PATH` before
configuring a new build directory.

### MSYS2 status and caveats

MSYS2 is not in the supported or CI-tested matrix. It may work, but no MSYS2
build has been reproduced for this project, so the project does not claim
support yet. In particular, combining MSYS-style paths with native Windows
Emscripten, CMake, Ninja, or `protoc.exe` can trigger automatic path conversion
and produce malformed compiler, preload-file, or protobuf arguments.

Use native PowerShell/CMD for the Windows toolchain, or WSL2 for a consistent
Linux toolchain. If you experiment with MSYS2, keep every tool and path model
consistent and include the exact shell and tool versions in any build report.

## Design system

The terminal's visual language (surfaces, text ramp, market-data semantics, heatmap LUTs) lives in [`design/`](design/README.md) as tokens, CSS, and ImGui mapping notes. `src/rendering/theme.{h,cpp}` mirrors those tokens into ImGui/ImPlot styles at runtime, so restyling starts there rather than in widget code.

## Architecture in one paragraph

The browser-facing main thread owns the WebSocket callbacks, ImGui/ImPlot, and WebGL rendering. Live binary frames are copied to a data worker for zstd and protobuf processing; order-book updates use a protected write/read model, while most other updates return through a time-budgeted main-thread dispatch queue. Replay creates an isolated manager set, then points the same widgets and renderers at it. See [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) for the source-linked build, threading, live-data, replay, rendering, and browser-deployment design.

## Contributing

Issues and PRs welcome. The most valuable contributions right now:

- Feed adapters for other exchanges and venues (the wire format is the contract)
- Widget improvements and new indicators
- Build and tooling portability (it should compile anywhere emsdk runs)

Please keep PRs focused. The render loop has strict conventions: no allocation in the frame path, `PriceFormatter` for all price text, theme tokens for all colors. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).
