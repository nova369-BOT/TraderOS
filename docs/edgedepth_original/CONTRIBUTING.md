# Contributing

Thanks for your interest. A few ground rules keep this maintainable by a very small team.

## Before you open a PR

- **Open an issue first for anything non-trivial.** Agreeing on the direction before you write code protects your time and ours.
- **Keep PRs small and single-purpose.** One widget, one fix, one behavior. Large or mixed PRs will be asked to split.
- **CI must pass.** Every PR is built with Emscripten on Ubuntu and native Windows, and the host-side tests run on both platforms. A red build won't be reviewed.

## Code conventions (enforced in review)

- `snake_case` for functions and variables, C++20, no exceptions in hot paths.
- **No heap allocation in the render loop.** No `std::string` construction, no vector growth, no per-frame `new`. Pre-size, reuse, or cache.
- All price text goes through `PriceFormatter`. Never `printf("%f")` a price.
- All colors come from `Theme::Tokens::*`, never a hardcoded `ImVec4` in a widget. New colors start life in [`design/tokens.json`](design/README.md), then get mirrored into the theme.
- Match the surrounding style. This codebase favors explicitness over cleverness.

## What we're most interested in

- Feed adapters and gateway implementations for other exchanges and venues
- Indicators and widget improvements
- Build and tooling portability fixes
- Performance work, with before/after frame-time numbers please

## What will likely be declined

- Large refactors of working systems ("modernization" PRs)
- New dependencies. The dependency set is deliberately small and pinned
- Features that require EdgeDepth's closed backend to test

## Native tests

The host-side test suite is CMake/CTest based and does not require Emscripten
or protoc. The workspace and flow positioning tests use the terminal's existing
nlohmann JSON 3.12.0 dependency, fetched on first configuration (or supplied
through CMake's `FETCHCONTENT_SOURCE_DIR_WORKSPACE_JSON` override for offline
builds). It covers the parts of the terminal that are pure enough to run off
the browser: the Renko and TPO chart transforms, the order
book's sorted container and its publish-on-frame double buffer, the ingest
queue's time-budgeted drain, the indicator series cache, replay entitlements,
route parsing, and the liquidation heatmap's reach maths.

There is no test framework. Each test is a single
source file with its own `main()`, a file-static failure counter, and small
`expect_*` helpers. Follow the shape of an existing one; please do not introduce
gtest, Catch2, or doctest. Tests must be deterministic: no sleeps, no wall-clock
reads, and no unseeded randomness. Where a module needs time, inject it.

These commands work from Bash, PowerShell, or CMD:

```text
cmake -S tests/native -B build-native-tests -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build-native-tests --config Release --parallel
cmake -E chdir build-native-tests ctest -C Release --output-on-failure
```

Linux and WSL contributors can also run `bash tests/native/run_tests.sh`.

A new test needs one line in `tests/native/CMakeLists.txt`:
`add_terminal_native_test(<target> <source>.cpp)`. CI picks it up from there.
Everything is built with `-Wall -Wextra -Werror` on GCC/Clang and `/W4 /WX` on
MSVC, so watch signed/unsigned comparisons.

## Expectations

This project is maintained alongside a running product. Triage happens in batches, typically weekly, so a quiet few days doesn't mean your PR is ignored. Issues are welcome, but this is not a support contract: "doesn't build" reports need the info in the issue template or they'll be closed.
