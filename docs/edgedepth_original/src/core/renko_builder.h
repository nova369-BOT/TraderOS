// RenkoBuilder - price-driven bricks from the candle CLOSE series
//
// Renko abandons time: X = brick ordinal, price drives the chart. A brick is a
// fixed-size step; a reversal needs 2x the brick size (traditional Renko). This
// builder is a PURE transform over the close series + a resolved brick size, so
// it is deterministic and replay-identical (the platform's replay/lesson/pack
// invariants depend on that).
//
// Committed bricks build from CLOSED candles only (rebuilt when the closed set /
// brick size / timeframe change). The live building candle folds in per frame
// via fold_building() into a separate provisional list, so the rightmost forming
// brick can appear/disappear as price moves without dirtying the committed cache.
// ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
